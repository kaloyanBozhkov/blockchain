SPA written with React JS to showcase the logic behind blockchain based technologies such as Bitcoin. It essentially gives the blockchain data structure a visual GUI representation, that users can interact with.

<h2>NOTE: This is not polished - there are no Jest/Enzyme tests here (yet?).</h2>
<p>This is because the total time dedicated to making this was ~4 full afternoons. I used it for presentation purposes at work, to help folks better understand what the blockchain data structure is.</p>
