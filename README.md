SPA written with React JS to showcase the logic behind blockchain based technologies such as Bitcoin. It essentially gives the blockchain data structure a visual GUI representation, that users can interact with.

<h2>NOTE: This is not polished, there are no unit tests or enforced linter. The total time dedicated to making this was ~ 4 afternoons. I used it for presentation purposes at work.</h2>
